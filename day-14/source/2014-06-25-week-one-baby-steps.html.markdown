This is one of my favorite quotes. And it seemed so apt now. The day was finally here. My first day at the IronYard. I had decided a few weeks
ago to step out of my comfort zone and begin a 12 week period of learning. I sat in
class super excited to meet my RoR cohort - I would be continuing this journey with them
for the  next 12 weeks. We started the day with getting to know each other a little bit and
setting up the environment. The following days were filled with homework, lots of learning
and ended with a weekend assignment that utilized all our learning we did thru' the week.
I have to travel more than 70 miles every day to class and back. This is probably
going to be the hardest part of it all. The mantra I tell myself? "Just persevere..
Persevere thru the bad traffic, the clutter at home, the pile of dishes in the sink.
Just persevere thru' this experience."
