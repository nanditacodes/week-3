Howlin' tornado. One of the rides I went in last summer at the Great Wolf
Lodge in Dallas, TX. It had me hanging on to dear life. Well - this week
was kinda like that. All concepts were new to me. Git, Middleman, TDD AND html/css.
If I thought last week was hard, this one was a new level of hard, defintiely
out of my comfort zone. So that part sucked - the initial discomfort that
comes with stepping out of my 'zen' place. My instructor, Jesse said that the
only way to get better at things is to do it more (Of course he said
it much better -I am para phrasing). I love the weekend assigment because it gives me an opportunity
to do just that. Practice more. It covers all the concepts we learnt during
the week. Like TDD and creating a HTML page to describe our
assignment and then taking it 'live'. This is definitely going to be an
interesting weekend.
