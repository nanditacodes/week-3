This course is intense! Week two was super hard, at least for me it was.
So many things to learn and remember. I am still feeling good about this
program. This is definitely one of the hardest things I have ever done.
But it feels good to go from one week to another; like an achievement.
A lot of ruby concepts were covered this week. We created a console game
app. It is wonderful to see different minds at work. Each one has their own
unqiue way of solving a problem and that's really cool to see. So far it has been a positive
experience in a positive environment.
